# Image Classification
## Project Overview:-
To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying images of cats and dogs, we will need to follow a series of steps, which includes loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance.
#
## Import Required Libraries:-
* NumPy for numerical operations.
* OpenCV or PIL for image handling.
* scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, accuracy_score) for implementing the SVM.
#
## Load the Dataset:-
* Use a dataset of cat and dog images. If you're working with the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset, download it and organize the data into folders.
# 
## Preprocess Images:-
* Resize the images to a fixed size (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
* Convert images to grayscale (if you're using color images, you could use RGB features, but grayscale simplifies it).
* Normalize the pixel values to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
* Flatten the images into 1D vectors since SVM doesn't work on image matrices directly.
#
## Prepare the Data:
* Label the images (e.g., 0 for cats and 1 for dogs).
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
#
## Train the SVM Model:
* Use SVC from scikit-learn to create an SVM classifier.
* Train the model on the flattened image data.
#
## Evaluate the Model:
* Test the trained model on unseen data and compute the accuracy.
* Optionally, use cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
#
## Conclusion:-
This project demonstrates the use of a traditional machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), for classifying images of cats and dogs. While SVM is not as commonly used as deep learning models for image classification tasks, it can still achieve good results on simpler datasets with appropriate preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.

By working through this project, one gains a deeper understanding of how to apply classical machine learning techniques to image data, along with the importance of data preprocessing and model evaluation.
