# Image Classification using SVM
<br>
# Project Overview
<br>
This project focuses on building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm effective for binary classification tasks like this one. By applying image preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM training, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between cat and dog images.
