# Image Classification
## Project Overview:-
### To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying images of cats and dogs, we will need to follow a series of steps, which includes loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance.
#
## Import Required Libraries:
** NumPy for numerical operations.
* OpenCV or PIL for image handling.
* scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, accuracy_score) for implementing the SVM.
