# Image Classification using SVM
<br>
# Project Overview
<br>
This project focuses on building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm effective for binary classification tasks like this one. By applying image preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM training, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between cat and dog images.

Technologies and Tools:
Python: Main programming language
Libraries:
scikit-learn for SVM, model training, and evaluation
OpenCV or Pillow for image preprocessing and handling
numpy for numerical operations

Expected Outcomes:
A fully trained SVM model that can classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
Understanding of how to preprocess image data and extract features for machine learning models.
Insights into how SVM works for image classification tasks.
A deployable model that can predict new images as either cat or dog.

Challenges:
Feature Extraction: Finding the best feature extraction method (HOG, deep learning features) for optimal SVM performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning the SVM's hyperparameters for the best results.
Computational Resources: SVM can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets or complex kernels.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SVM can be used for binary image classification tasks such as distinguishing between cats and dogs. By combining image preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM model training, you will gain a deep understanding of how machine learning models handle real-world image classification problems.
